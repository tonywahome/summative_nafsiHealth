NAFSI HEALTH PROJECT PROPOSAL






My mission is to increase access to quality healthcare by leveraging technological tools to bridge the gap between health institutions and marginalised communities to deliver personalized, affordable care across Sub-Saharan Africa.     

Problem statement: 
   This project is named NAFSI which is a Swahili word that means soul or spirit . The names inspires people to adopt to new technological tools in the healthcare sector that are affordable and personalized for each user.
The main problem is the is an existing gap in healthcare in Sub-Saharan Africa where marginalised communities are disenfranchised from the healthcare system.
The main stakeholders are marginalised communities, healthcare systems and healthcare practitioners. The problem exists in developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.
The problem exists because the governments in the countries face corruption and poor planning of public healthcare systems. This solution is trying to connect marginalised communities to the healthcare system by using technological tools such as telemedicine and Bio-technology. 
Software Development Model:
For the NAFSI Health Project, an Agile development model is most appropriate. This is because:
Iterative Development: Agile emphasizes iterative development with frequent feedback loops, allowing for flexibility and adaptation to changing requirements. This is crucial in a project like this, where user needs and technological advancements may evolve rapidly.
Collaboration: Agile promotes close collaboration between developers, healthcare practitioners, and end-users, ensuring the system meets the specific needs of the target communities.
Continuous Improvement: The iterative nature of Agile allows for continuous improvement and refinement of the system based on user feedback and real-world usage data.
Software Development Model Steps:
Requirement Gathering: Engage with stakeholders (patients, healthcare practitioners, administrators) to gather detailed requirements and prioritize features.
Sprint Planning: Divide the project into short sprints (e.g., 2-4 weeks) with clearly defined goals and deliverables.
Development: Develop and test the software iteratively, focusing on delivering high-priority features first.
Testing and Feedback: Conduct thorough testing and gather feedback from users after each sprint.
Deployment: Deploy the working software incrementally, allowing for early user adoption and feedback.
Review and Retrospect: Regularly review the project progress and identify areas for improvement in the next sprint.
Hypothesis of the Solution:
We anticipate that the NAFSI Health Project will:
Increase access to healthcare: By providing a platform for remote consultations, the project will enable marginalized communities to access healthcare services regardless of their location.
Improve health outcomes: Timely access to care and health information will lead to better health outcomes for the target population.
Empower patients: The project will empower patients with knowledge and tools to manage their health proactively.
Strengthen healthcare systems: By facilitating communication and collaboration among healthcare providers, the project will contribute to strengthening healthcare systems in Sub-Saharan Africa.

2. Class Diagram

Description: The Class Diagram depicts the structure of the system by showing its classes, attributes, methods, and relationships among objects. For the NAFSI Health Project, we’ll create classes for key entities such as Patient, Doctor, Appointment, MedicalRecord, and Administrator.
Key Classes and Relationships:
Patient: Attributes could include name, age, medical history, and methods like bookConsultation(), viewHealthResources().
Doctor: Attributes include specialization, consultationHistory, and methods like updateMedicalRecord(), scheduleAppointment().
Appointment: Includes attributes such as appointmentDate, status, and methods like schedule(), reschedule().
MedicalRecord: Contains patientID, testResults, and methods for adding or updating medical data.
Administrator: Manages users, appointments, and records.
Relationships:
Patient-Appointment: A patient can have multiple appointments, but each appointment is associated with only one patient.
Doctor-Appointment: A doctor can manage multiple appointments.
Doctor-MedicalRecord: A doctor can update multiple medical records, but each record is specific to one patient.

3. Activity Diagram


Description: An Activity Diagram represents the flow of activities in a process, showcasing the steps taken by users in the system. This diagram will focus on a typical patient consultation workflow.
Steps in the Process:
Patient Initiates Consultation: The patient logs in to the app, schedules an appointment, and enters details.
Doctor Receives Request: The doctor reviews the request and confirms availability.
Virtual Consultation: The patient and doctor meet virtually. The doctor reviews patient history and updates medical records if needed.
Conclusion: The doctor shares medical records, gives health advice, and schedules the next consultation if needed.

4. Sequence Diagram


Description: A Sequence Diagram shows the interactions between objects in a sequence, detailing how information is passed between them over time. Here, we’ll focus on the interaction between a patient, doctor, and the system during a virtual consultation.
Flow:
Patient sends a request to System to schedule a consultation.
System confirms the appointment and sends the confirmation to the Patient.
At the time of the consultation, Patient sends their medical details to the Doctor.
Doctor receives the medical history and shares advice with the Patient.
If necessary, the Doctor updates the MedicalRecord and sends an updated version back to the Patient.
